#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software Engineering refers to the application of engineering principles in the design, testing, deployment and maintenance of sotware.
  It is important in the technology industry as it ensures that software systems are reliable, efficient, scalable and maintainable.
  It does this through allowing for structured code development, cost and time efficiency, security, scalability and maintainability and user satisfaction.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. The Introduction of structured programming - Edsger Dijkstra promoted structured programming as an alternative to unstructured code, advocating for the use of loops, conditionals,         and subroutines. This was through encouraging the use of loops, conditionals and subroutines.
  2. Development of the waterfall model - Winston W. Royce introduced the Waterfall model, one of the first formalized software development life cycle (SDLC) methodologies.  These             provided a sequential approach to software development, emphasizing software development in phases such as design, implementation, testing and maintainance.
  3. Rise of the Agile Methodology - The Agile Manifesto introduced flexible, iterative development practices, emphasizing collaboration, customer feedback, and continuous improvement.
      Agile revolutionized how teams deliver software, making development faster and more adaptive to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Planning:
     This phase involves defining project goals, scope, resources, timeline, and budget. It includes feasibility studies and risk assessments to ensure project viability.
  2. Requirement Analysis:
     Stakeholders and developers gather and document functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring a clear understanding of what the software should achieve.
  3. Design:
     The system architecture and design are created based on the requirements. This includes high-level system design, database design, and user interface design.
  4. Implementation (Coding):
     Developers write code based on the design specifications. This is the phase where the actual software product is built.
  5. Testing:
     The software undergoes thorough testing to identify and fix bugs, ensuring it meets requirements and functions correctly.
  6. Deployment:
     After successful testing, the software is released to users. This can involve deployment to production environments or app stores, depending on the project type.
  7. Maintenance:
     Once deployed, the software requires regular updates, bug fixes, and improvements to address user feedback and evolving requirement


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  
    The Waterfall and Agile methodologies differ significantly in their approach to software development. The Waterfall methodology follows a linear, sequential process where each phase—     planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance—must be completed before moving to the next. It is rigid and less adaptable to changes, making it suitable for      projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change. For example, developing software for government systems or medical devices, where strict documentation and            approvals are necessary, aligns well with the Waterfall approach.

    In contrast, Agile is an iterative and incremental approach that divides the project into smaller cycles called sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks. Agile embraces               flexibility, allowing continuous feedback and changes throughout development. This approach encourages regular collaboration between developers and stakeholders, ensuring the final       product aligns with evolving user needs. Agile is ideal for projects where requirements are expected to change, such as mobile app development or startup projects, where user             feedback can shape the product's direction.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    The Software Developer is responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code based on project requirements. They collaborate with designers, analysts, and other developers to         implement features and functionalities. Developers also troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and ensure the software adheres to coding standards. Their role extends to               participating in code reviews and documentation to ensure future maintainability.

    The Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer focuses on ensuring the software meets quality standards and functions as intended. They design and execute test plans, including manual and           automated testing, to identify bugs and inconsistencies. QA engineers also conduct performance, security, and usability testing while working closely with developers to resolve           issues. Their ultimate goal is to deliver a stable, reliable product that meets user requirements.

    The Project Manager (PM) oversees the entire project, ensuring it stays on schedule, within budget, and meets the defined scope. They coordinate between stakeholders, developers, and     QA engineers, facilitating communication and resolving conflicts. Project managers also handle risk management, resource allocation, and project tracking using methodologies like         Agile or Waterfall to ensure timely delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    IDEs provide developers with a comprehensive environment for writing, editing, testing, and debugging code. They combine multiple tools, such as code editors, compilers, debuggers,       and build automation, into a single platform, making development more efficient. IDEs offer features like syntax highlighting, code suggestions, error detection, and project               management, significantly reducing development time and improving code accuracy. Popular examples include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse. These tools enable     developers to work more efficiently, especially on complex projects that involve multiple files and dependencies.

    Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential for tracking changes in code, enabling developers to collaborate seamlessly while maintaining code integrity. VCS allows multiple               developers to work on the same project simultaneously, merge changes, and roll back to previous versions if issues arise. It provides a detailed history of modifications, making it       easier to identify when and why changes were made. There are two main types of VCS: centralized (e.g., Subversion (SVN)) and distributed (e.g., Git). Git, paired with platforms like      GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, is the most widely used, offering powerful branching, merging, and collaboration features.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  1. Unit Testing:
    Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation to ensure they work as expected. Developers usually write unit tests during development,     often using frameworks like JUnit for Java or PyTest for Python. This type of testing helps catch bugs early, ensures code reliability, and simplifies debugging.

  2. Integration Testing:
    Integration testing focuses on verifying the interactions between different modules or components of the software. Since individual units might work perfectly in isolation but fail       when combined, integration testing ensures smooth communication between components. It can be performed using approaches like top-down, bottom-up, or sandwich testing.

  3. System Testing:
    System testing evaluates the complete, integrated software system to ensure it meets specified requirements. This testing is conducted in an environment that mimics the production         environment and covers functional and non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, and usability.

  4. Acceptance Testing:
    Acceptance testing is the final phase of testing, where the software is evaluated from the end user's perspective. It ensures the product meets business requirements and is ready for     deployment. This type of testing can be divided into User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Alpha/Beta Testing, where real users validate the software.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, ensuring accurate, relevant, and desired outputs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

  A vague prompt would be something like "Tell me about Engineering" while a detailed prompt or improved prompt would be something like "Tell me about the different branches of             engineering, discussing their applications and importances."
  A detailed prompt focuses on streamlinig the queries in order to get the most effective output from an AI model. It is non-ambiguous and states precisely what is needed and the           boundaries to be applied so as to prevent receiving useless infromation.
